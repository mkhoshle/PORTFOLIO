# About This Project:
A researcher needs your statistical expertise to evaluate an intervention. The six-month intervention was to give subjects a special exercise plan. The 
researcher randomized 2,500 people to the treatment group (which receives the intervention) and another 2,500 to the control group (does not receive the 
intervention). The physician wishes to evaluate the subjects’ health outcomes (weight and self-rated health) before the start of the intervention and 
immediately after the intervention. The physician wants to know whether the new exercise plan will affect one’s overall health (measured by change in 
weight and self-rated health) differently for those receiving the new exercise plan versus those not receiving the exercise plan.
