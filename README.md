## Welcome 

This repository contains some of my projects in Python and R. They vary in subject and scope and cover Bayesian statistics, data engineering, Deep learning, tatistical analysis, machine learning, data acquisition, data cleaning, data exploration, and data visuzalition. If you have any questions or feedback about any of my projects (data sources, inspiration, critiques) please contact me at mahzadkhoshlessan@gmail.com.


### [AI for Energy: Using NLP to Find Barriers to Humanizing Energy Transition](https://github.com/mkhoshle/PORTFOLIO.github.io/tree/master/AI-for-Energy)
The philosophy behind this project is to find ways that governments can benefit from to involve
people in accelerating energy transition and taking advantage of sustainable energy
resources. In fact, people play an important role besides state-of-the-art technologies and
business boosters. How could we get these insights? I used NLP to answer this question.

### [Parallel Analysis of Molecular Dynamic Trajectories](https://github.com/mkhoshle/paper-hpc-py-parallel-mdanalysis)
Paper draft investigating approaches to increase the performance of analysing MD trajectories with Python on HPC resources.
