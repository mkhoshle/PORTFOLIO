# About This Project
Single molecule localization microscopy (SMLM) is widely used to determine the
organization and stoichiometry of protein complexes. The information obtained
by counting methods is especially relevant in unraveling complex multi-protein
processes. An important theoretical challenge arises from the fact that single
molecules are only indirectly monitored through photons emitted from their
fluorescent labels that, themselves, can exhibit complex photo-physics. Here,
we introduce a specialized software for quantitative analysis of SMLM data for
biological interpretations. Our method uses novel tools from Bayesian nonparametric
that take fluorophore blinking kinetics directly into account and
are capable of estimating the number of particles, their state trajectory, the
photo-kinetic rates and emission parameters. We further quantify the number
of clusters in a region of interest (ROI) and histogram of the number of proteins
localized in small clusters without the need to spatially resolve them. To do so,
we use the number of photon arrivals collected from these 
fluorescent proteins.
We also benchmark our approach on synthetic data to draw conclusions on
the spatial relation of T-cell receptors (TCRs) on T-cell microvilli.
