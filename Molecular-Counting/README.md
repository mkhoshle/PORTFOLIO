# About This Project 
Single molecule localization microscopy (SMLM) is widely used to determine the
organization and stoichiometry of protein complexes. The information obtained
by counting methods is especially relevant in unraveling complex multi-protein
processes. An important theoretical challenge arises from the fact that single
molecules are only indirectly monitored through photons emitted from their

uorescent labels that, themselves, can exhibit complex photo-physics. Here,
we introduce a specialized software for localization and molecular counting of
SMLM data for biological interpretations. In this project it is tried to study,
understand and produce the results presented in [here](https://github.com/EliasNehme/Deep-STORM). A deep convolutional neural
network is used to quantify the number of particles in a region of interest (ROI).
This method is parameter free and is able to overcome important theoretical
challenge arises from the complex photo-physics of single molecules. We validate
the code by super-resolution image reconstruction of simulated data from [here](https://github.com/EliasNehme/Deep-STORM).
